Part number:        SATA-SNIFFER v0.1c

General fabrication notes

    * Boards are be individually routed.
    * Board material is Taiwan Union TU872 and Shengyi S1000-2M (see stackup notes)
    * Red solder mask on both sides of board.
    * White silkscreen text on both sides of board.
    * Pad finish is ENIG.
    * Finished board thickness is 1.6 mm.
    * Place UL mark and date code in the area marked on the "F. Fab" gerber layer.
    * Boards to be rotated 10 degrees on to panel, to reduce fiber weave effect
