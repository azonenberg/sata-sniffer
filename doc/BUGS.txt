1) Incorrect silkscreen on TX- SMA connector
J6, the southernmost SMA connector, is actually the TX- signal however the silkscreen text says "RX-".

2) MAC address EEPROM was originally planned to be included on the board, but never made it into the schematic

3) FPGA gets pretty hot, should have planned for active cooling. Easy to bodge on a 12V fan though.
